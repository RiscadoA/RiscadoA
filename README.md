### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Ricardo Antunes, currently a first year student of Computer Science and Engineering at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico, Lisbon, Portugal.

My main area of interest right now in software development is game development. I have been working on and off on some personal basic game engines for some years now, which have given me a lot of experience with OpenGL, C and C++.
