### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Ricardo Antunes, currently a student of Computer Science and Engineering at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico, Lisbon, Portugal.

My main area of interest in software engineering was initially game development - I learned a lot writing my own game engines during the final years of high school. Today, I'm doing a masters on distributed systems and cyber security.

Although I'm not pursuing studies in game development, I still find it really interesting and fun! I'm currently leading the [**CUBOS.**](https://github.com/GameDevTecnico/cubos) team, and our goal is to develop an open-source ECS based voxel game engine.

Overall, my main interests are:
- Distributed Systems
- Databases
- Compilers
- Game Engine Development

Within the game (engine) development part, I'm really interested in:
- GPU programming, from physics to graphics
- Entity Component System, it's cool to apply database concepts to games
- Autonomous Agents
