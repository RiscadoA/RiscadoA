### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Ricardo Antunes, currently a third year student of Computer Science and Engineering at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico, Lisbon, Portugal.

My main area of interest in software development has been game development for a long time. I have been working on and off on some personal basic game engines for some years now, which have given me a lot of experience with OpenGL, C and C++.

Right now my focus is expanding my knowledge to other languages, such as Rust, Java and Javascript.
